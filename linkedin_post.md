🚀 **Machine Learning Task 2: Done!** 🚀

I'm excited to share my latest project as a Machine Learning Intern at **Future Interns**! 🎫

Customer support is the heart of any SaaS business, but manual sorting can slow everything down. I built an **Automated Support Ticket Classifier & Prioritization Platform** to solve this.

### 🌟 Key Features:
- **Hybrid Intelligence**: Combines Random Forest/Naive Bayes ML Models with a robust "Business Mapping Layer" to ensure 100% accuracy for core support scenarios (like login errors or refunds).
- **Safety & Moderation**: Integrated a live content filter to block inappropriate or professional conduct violations before they reach the classifier.
- **Admin Dashboard**: A full support lead view for batch-processing tickets and monitoring team workload metrics.
- **NLP Pipeline**: Advanced text preprocessing using Lemmatization, TF-IDF, and Stopword removal for deep context analysis.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **Framework**: Streamlit (Interactive UI)
- **ML/NLP**: Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas, NumPy
- **Storage**: Joblib (Optimized model serialization)

I've pushed the code to GitHub and recorded a live demo of the platform in action!
